# Home Credit Default Risk HCDR
 
In this project, I tackled the challenge of predicting default probabilities for Home Credit clients using historical data to enhance lending decisions and minimize unpaid loans. My primary goal was to construct a robust machine learning model by performing feature engineering, hyper parameter tuning, and experimenting with various algorithms. Initial phases focused on logistic regression, random forests, KNN, decision trees, and ensemble methods.


In the final phase, I expanded my analysis to include Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, specifically the enhanced MLP (Model 2) and Model 3 (Deep wide selected). The main experiments involved optimizing these models by fine-tuning hyper parameters and selecting relevant features. Model 2 achieved a training accuracy of 0.7411, test accuracy of 0.6806, and test F1 score of 0.6925. Model 3 demonstrated strong performance with a training accuracy of 0.7576, test accuracy of 0.6806, and test F1 score of 0.7029. These models obtained a private score of 0.74369 and a public score of 0.7537.


My findings highlight the importance of feature engineering, hyper parameter tuning, and advanced model architectures in predicting clients' likelihood of default. Future improvements may include further hyper parameter exploration, enhanced feature selection, increasing data set size, and utilizing advanced ensemble methods to boost model performance and positively impact lending decisions, ultimately promoting financial inclusion for under-served populations.
